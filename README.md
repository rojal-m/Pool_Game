                                        Classic 8-Ball Pool

In this project we have built a classical billiard game using SFML library in C++ programming. The start menu includes two different billiard games, 8 ball and 9 ball. 
The game stimulates a billiard table with a cue ball and "object balls". The cue ball can be hit with a force using the mouse motions and  the balls can roll on the table with simulating friction. We also implemented the necessary physics to stimulate the collision between a ball and a sidewall, as well as between two balls. Sound effects were added to the game in order to create a sense of realism.
