     *   screen),
     * - Fill the states map with the States needed during the game
     * - spawn a window with the specified titlebar, width and height

    /*
     * Run the main loop of the state machine, and therefore by extension
     * the entire game.
     *
     * Each iteration of the main loop go through these steps:
     * - Handle all window events from the event queue (these include
     *   key presses/releases, mouse movement, resizing of the window
     *   and more).
     *
     *   What this means is that we check if the user has requested
     *   to close the window and therefore the game, and for any other
     *   events we pass them on to the state.
     * - Update the current state.
     *
     *   This means running any logic that the state might have, for
     *   example; move objects, check for collision, manage resources
     *   etc. This step will probably perform the vast majority of the
     *   logic in the project (depending on the project of course).
     *
     * - Draw the currently active state to the window.
     *
     *   This step will simply pass the window to the state and will
     *   thus allow the state to draw itself onto the windows. This
     *   is beneficial since we now have completely decoupled the
     *   state from the Game class, thus allowing all behaviour of a
     *   state to be implemented in the corresponding class without
     *   having to touch any other code.
